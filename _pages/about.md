I'm a Mechanical Engineer currently working in aerospace R&D and studying for my master's degree. 

# Work Experience

My current work focuses on research and developement of aerospace devices utilizing advanced composites. Some things I've worked on include:
* Design and testing of quasi-static, dynamic, and gun-launch test systems
* Coding custom simulation software to predict material properties of exotic composite materials
* Oversee test series focusing on the rapid prototyping of composite systems and test fixtures
* Automate tasks such as report-writing, test sample documentation, and organization of test results

I've also worked previously as a lab technician and assembly technician, gaining experience in machining, electrical systems, and sensor data acquisition. 

# Academic Experience

My research experience is focused on solid mechanics, elastic waves, and the use of ultrasonics in nondestructive evaluation. Specifically, my Master's Thesis focuses on the impact of additively manufactured (3D printed) materials on ultrasound propagation during nondestructive testing. 

During my undergraduate studies, I was able to work as a teaching assistant for classes focusing on CAD, programming, and project management. 

# Interests

I'm interested in many branches of science and engineering, particularly those applied to space exploration. 

Outside of my interests in STEM, I'm a novice SCUBA diver, volunteer with my local fire department as an EMT, and enjoy programming & game development.
