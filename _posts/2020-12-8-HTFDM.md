## Summary

I developed a FDM-Based heat transfer simulation with the goal of simulating temperature profiles through 2D objects. The user may input material properties, size of the simulation, and then 'draw' the layout of the simulation using an OpenCV-based window. The inputs are then formulated into a matrix of equations, which are solved either by use of a custom Gauss-Seidel solver or by SciPY's sparse matrix solver. The results may then be viewed as a heatmap.

This image shows the temperature profile simulated across a wall with a U-channel beam on the right-hand side. The gradient of the temperature is also calculated to visualize the thermal conductivity of various parts of the wall.

A diagram of the wall simulated is shown below.

The code was also used to simulate other scenarios, such as this turbine blade with a cooling channel down the middle of the blade.
