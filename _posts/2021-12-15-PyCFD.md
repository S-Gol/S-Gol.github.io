## Summary
Using Python, I developed a 2D Direct Navier Stokes solver accelerated by using Numba's JIT tools and OpenCV to render the images in real time. It features fully dynamic incompressible flow, with the ability to edit boundary conditions from scripts at runtime. This can be used to, for example, automate the generation of geoemtry to optimize for drag or lift. The math behind it is based on the 12 Steps to Navier Stokes program, which I extended and generalized for use with more general boundary conditions.

The flow is fully dynamic, allowing for simulation of phenomena like boundary layer separation and vortice generation. This video was generated in a simulation of a circle in a flow with a Reynold's Number of approximately 100, which corresponds to unsteady flow with no vortex development.

Comparing the flows to simulation in ANSYS Fluent shows very similar flow patterns.

Slight discrepancies are present due to the way that boundary conditions are set up between the two programs. Overall, the free-stream flow patterns are nearly identical.
